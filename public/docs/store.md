# Savage Worlds Dice

Beautiful 3D dice extension designed specifically for Savage Worlds Adventure Edition (SWADE)

## Rolling Dice

Add dice to your tray from the available SWADE dice types (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12). Press and hold on the dice tray to charge up your throw, then release to roll.

The extension uses realistic 3D physics simulation to determine results, with beautiful animations and sound effects.

## Savage Worlds Features

**Trait Tests**
- Roll a single trait die (d4-d12) for skill and attribute tests
- Optional Wild Die (d6) that rolls alongside your trait die
- Automatic success and raise calculation against target numbers
- Modifier support for situational bonuses/penalties

**Damage Rolls**
- Multiple dice of different types for weapon damage
- All dice explode on maximum values with animated explosions
- Separate damage modifiers

**Exploding Dice (Aces)**
- Dice automatically "explode" when they roll their maximum value
- New dice spawn and roll, adding to your total
- Explosion chains are clearly marked in the results

**Detailed Results Display**
- Complete breakdown of each roll with individual die results
- Clear indication of which dice exploded and their explosion chains
- Success/failure status and raise count for trait tests
- Shows which die (trait or wild) was used for the final result

**Roll Sharing & History**

When you make a roll, the results are automatically shared with other players in your session in real-time. The extension shows a bottom tray with recent rolls from all players, making it easy to see what everyone rolled.

**Local Roll History**

Click the search icon in the sidebar to access your personal roll history. You can quickly reroll any of your previous dice combinations, and the extension will remember your settings (target numbers, modifiers, wild die preferences).

**Private Rolls**

Make rolls privately so only you can see the results.

**Roll History**

Quick access to recent rolls for re-rolling or referencing past results.

**Fairness Testing**

Built-in distribution analysis tools help verify the randomness and fairness of dice rolls for those who want to validate the physics simulation.
