# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Modules
- `src/`: TypeScript/React source.
  - `controls/`, `dice/`, `tray/`: UI and interaction components.
  - `plugin/`: Owlbear Rodeo extension glue and integration.
  - `materials/`, `meshes/`, `colliders/`, `previews/`: 3D assets and rendering helpers.
  - `helpers/`, `hooks/`, `types/`, `constants/`: utilities, shared types, and config.
  - `sets/`: dice set definitions (edit to add new sets).
- `public/`: static files served as‑is.
- `dist/`: production build output (generated by Vite).
- `docs/`: project documentation and images.

## Build, Test, and Dev
- Install: `yarn`
- Develop: `yarn dev` — starts Vite dev server.
- Build: `yarn build` — type‑checks (`tsc`) then builds to `dist/`.
- Preview: `yarn preview` — serves the production build locally.

## Coding Style & Naming
- Language: TypeScript + React (Vite).
- Indentation: 2 spaces; use semicolons and double quotes.
- Components/types: PascalCase (`InteractiveTray`, `DiceRoll`).
- Variables/functions: camelCase (`getDieFromDice`).
- Files: React components `*.tsx`; shared types in `src/types/`.
- Exports: prefer named exports; keep modules focused and small.
- No repo linter config; match existing style. Run `yarn build` before pushing to catch typing issues.

## Testing Guidelines
- No automated unit tests are configured.
- Manual fairness tooling lives in `src/tests/` (e.g., FairnessTester). Use the UI button to run roll distributions and review charts during development.

## Commit & PR Guidelines
- Commits: prefer Conventional Commits where practical (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`); write imperative, concise messages.
- PRs should include:
  - Clear description and rationale; link related issues.
  - Screenshots/GIFs for UI changes.
  - Scope limited to one topic; pass `yarn build` locally.
  - Notes on any asset additions (sizes, formats) and performance implications.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Do not commit secrets; this project ships static assets only.
- Keep textures optimized (JPG/PNG) and models lightweight to preserve load times.
- Vite/TypeScript configuration lives in `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig*.json`; update thoughtfully and in small PRs.
